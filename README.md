# Concise Configurable Composable Classes Stylesheets (C4S)

C4S [*c force*] is a functional, customizable CSS library for front-end web development.

## Get started

- Go to the [C4S website](https://c4s.cdijkman.nl) for an overview of the available
  stylesheets and the project's documentation.
- Include a C4S stylesheet in your HTML and you're good to go!

## Install with Node Package Manager (`npm`)

- `npm install --save-dev @casd/c4s`

or with `yarn`

- `yarn add --dev @casd/c4s`

The pre-built .css files can be found in the [`dist`](./dist) directory.

You can use C4S with SCSS, just [import](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/)
the main file with `@use 'node_modules/@casd/c4s/src/c4s';`

For customizing, you can start by copying [c4s-custom.scss](./src/c4s-custom.scss) into
your project and customize all you like ðŸ˜„
