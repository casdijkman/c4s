   SPACERS

   There are eight levels of spacers, including $spacer-0, which is level 0
   $spacer-0 is always 0. After $spacer-1, every next spacer is twice the size of the last
   Levels  1 through 7 therefore represent the product of $spacer-base with powers of two
   $spacer-4 and is considered 'medium' size and is the product of $spacer-base and 2^0
 */

// $spacer-4 is equal to $spacer-base and vice versa
$spacer-base: 2rem !default;

$spacer-0: 0;
$spacer-1: $spacer-base * power-of-two(-3);
$spacer-2: $spacer-base * power-of-two(-2);
$spacer-3: $spacer-base * power-of-two(-1);
$spacer-4: $spacer-base * power-of-two(0);
$spacer-5: $spacer-base * power-of-two(1);
$spacer-6: $spacer-base * power-of-two(2);
$spacer-7: $spacer-base * power-of-two(3);
