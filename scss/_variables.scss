   SPACERS

   There are eight levels of spacers, including $spacer-0, which is level 0
   $spacer-0 is 0. After $spacer-1, every next spacer is twice the size of the last
   Levels  1 through 7 therefore represent the product of $spacer-base with powers of two
   $spacer-4 and is considered 'medium' size and is the product of $spacer-base and 2^0
